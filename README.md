#Script: Adobe_Suite_Removal_macOS.sh

 Remove Adobe Creative Cloud Cruff or fix a Adobe corrupted System that prevents Adobe products to run or install.

 Usage: sudo ./Adobe_Suite_Removal_macOS.sh

 On macOS, the Adobe uninstaller does not remove all things Adobe leaving remnants behind that will run in the background and hit log files for failures. Also, when installing managed Adobe Packages, they often need a fresh system without Adobe on it to either install or run the programs. This script will rip out most if not all Adobe Creative Cloud Suite of programs and remnants to make your system cleaner for a fresh install.
 For macOS X --> MacOS Current version


This was created to manage a Maclab using Adobe Suite managed Packages, since Adobe uninstaller just does not go far enough and prevented us from getting new or updated instances of ACC to work until this script was used to rip Adobe out of the system (daemons and applications)
